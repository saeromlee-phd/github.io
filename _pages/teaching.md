## Selected Comments from Students

- Every time Mr. Silva walked into class he would say "hello" to everyone which immediately brings a warm and friendly atmosphere before
even starting class and I enjoyed that. Secondly, Mr. Silva would try to recap where we were as a class in the beginning of lecture to make sure everyone was on the same page. The material was presented in a simple and not overly complicated way. Just straight to the point and only the content that we needed to know for class. The materials that we did learn were also related to real life events and companies which I think help people to feel more motivated to learn the material. Thank you.

- Excellent class. The course and teaching style was very straightforward. Very fair tests and grading. There were no surprise material
questions on the exams. Every part of the material was reflected on the exams as expected and as we went over in class. Review session
was very helpful and encouraged clarifications and questions. Instructor was very approachable.

- I really benefited from both having the lecture notes and from you walking us through the material in detail step-by-step in class. You have great pacing, so you made it feel as though the class wasn't rushed even though this session was 2x speed. Since the practice problems you went through in class and homework were representative of the class, I was able to use them to study.

- Could be a future professor from how professional, respectful, and nice he is.

- Murilo Silva was extremely helpful. He made three-hour classes feel shorter than they were and provided plenty of resources for us to study for exams. He also went over many examples during class that helped us out a lot.

- Murilo Silva is a great TA, love how I am able to ask him questions when I do not understand the lecture without feeling nervous. Since I typically don't because I am extremely shy and feel as if I am asking a rhetorical question. Yet, with this TA I don't. He is also very knowledgeable and will make sure you full understand before moving on.

- Fantastic TA, Best TA I've ever had. He is extremely approachable, friendly, and always willing to help. Really takes his time during office hours to make sure I understand the material. His English is great and very clear (he barely has an accent). He taught the material very well, and was willing to answer questions beyond the scope of the class which was amazing. He really taught lessons for life. Additionally, he always replied to emails very quickly. He provided a lot of in-depth feedback on homeworks and tests, even if the homeworks were just graded for completion. He is overall just a great and helpful TA, and made the class very enjoyable.

- Mr. Silva has been one of the most amazing TAs I have had since I began my college education. He went over the past homework
assignments which was very helpful for studying for the exams. In addition, he would help highlight the most important problems to study on the homework practice sets. In class, he was able to explain each question with ease and explained it in a way that was very easy to follow. If anyone had a question he always knew the answer and was very approachable during discussions. He did not waste time going over
information that was not important and was able to use the short time he had every week very efficiently. His demeanor and excellent
knowledge of topics would make him an amazing lecturer if he chooses to go down that path. If he ended up teaching an economics course I
would definitely take it as he was that excellent as a TA. I could not rate him highly enough in his expertise as a resource to help me succeed in this class.

- Murilo is very kind and thorough when demonstrating how to solve a problem. He explains why we have to use certain formulas for certain
problems, and also explains exactly what the question is asking for. He always encourages us to ask questions if we don't understand
something, and is more than willing to review a problem anyone needs help on.

- Murilo Silva is extremely helpful and always encourages students to do their best! I really enjoyed taking the lab and got a chance to meet new students! It was really fun to learn about the new statistics formulas and to connect it back to Economics. He is really hardworking and always makes sure that the students are always included!

- I really liked this TA, he is a nice person, but more importantly, he holds a great understanding for the material and helps breakdown complex topics into simple and fun lessons. He is the reason I have an A+ in the class. Thank you Murilo!!

- One of the best TAs at UCR, in my opinion. Always willing to help and made sure to answer all of our questions. Responded to emails really fast, even on weekend which is awesome.

- He is great. I understood the class material much better after attending office hours and discussion. He was patient and easy to understand in emails. He is good with names which is also nice because he remembers the people he helps.

- Murilo was one of the best discussion instructors I had this quarter. He would even write down the key concepts before class started. Murilo also allowed students to be engaged with the correct answer. I felt like I knew how to excel in the class because of the way I performed during the discussion.

- This guy is amazing. He was more useful than the professor at explaining and breaking down the material. So greatful to have had such a
good TA on my first quarter here at UCR. Keep up the great work!!

- He was one of my most caring and attentive TAs during Winter Quarter. He clearly knows the content he teaches, and he creates a safe
environment for students to ask questions and explore different areas of the subject. Going to his discussion sections was always a pleasure!

- An amazing TA overall, very helpful and communicative. Went above and beyond to assist students to help us understand the course
material and it was very helpful. No complaints or improvements suggested, thank you for being so helpful!

- His discussion are really useful he makes context easy to understand and makes good use of his discussions by providing helpful acedemic tools. One of the best ta I've ever had. He's really good at explaining even complicated topics and is well prepared and knows what he's talking about.

- TA Silva is a great TA. He helped me understand every question in the homework and actively answered questions raised by students. This
allowed me to be well-prepared before the exam. Overall, the learning experience in TA Silva's course was great.

- He was always super nice and you could clearly tell he cared a lot about his students. His discussions were incredibly helpful and he did a very nice job at explaining why answers were wrong and why they were right. He really contributed to my understanding of the material. He always went above and beyond in discussion when it came to writing out the formulas, equations, and definitions on the white board. I’m glad he was my TA for a class that was at times pretty difficult.

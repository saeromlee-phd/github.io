Welcome!

I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at UC Riverside.

My research focuses on Applied Econometrics, with a specialization in Empirical Macroeconomics and Finance. I am particularly interested in Time Series Analysis, Forecasting, and leveraging Data Science and Machine Learning techniques for practical applications.
